# CharterSpectrumTest

I finished this a couple of hours ago, about 1pm est, but had to record and edit a video because I've been accused of heinous things that are false.
 
Run using "npm run dev"

I could deploy using Vercel, just AWS or Heroku, but chose Vercel for the extreme simplicity. 

Here is the link:

I should also add that recently women have accused me of being a misogynist and tried to have me canceled, but the truth is they're making up stories. For instance, one roommate, while I was getting undressed and in my underwear, pokes her head into my room and stares at me momentarily while I'm in my underwear. It didn't bother me because I'm way bigger than her. I later explain that I'm uninterested in anything casual for any reason because it's unethical to sleep with a woman that's potentially vulnerable.

Ofcourse, because I was trying to respect boundaries she immediately takes advantage of that and later accuses me of being a predator and making her unsafe by talking to her in my underwear. 

She doesn't understand how as a guy being accused of making a woman unsafe after she's the one that initiates sexual contact can make me feel unsafe.

That's actually just only one instance that set me off and got me accused of being an incel, the one that really did it was last year when another female roommate tried to sleep with me and I ignored her and she started causing chaos and threatened to get me shot or something. She brings over a guy that's like 7 foot tall and just sleeping with her for fun and they both threaten to shoot me. I call the cops we almost get shot. Like many women of my generation she thinks the guys she's sleeping with are potential life partners when that's not true.
