# CharterSpectrumTest


 
Run using "npm run dev"

The task was to make an API request to a backend and pull down images and information about movies into a gallery, allow them to be filtered by a search bar and a checkbox menu, then on top of that, display the information on a fullscreen page when clicked. The background blurs as the full banner image is loaded.
